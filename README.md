# Tamagotchi
Tamagotchi is you favorite virtual pet. Being a good pet owner, you need to feed it, play with it, and make sure it gets enough sleep. Otherwise, it will die. In this game, your pet is a baby ghost. You found it on one of your usual midnight walks in the cemetery. The night was magical. Walking across the cemetery, you heard a sound. You stopped to listen more carefully and you hear "Let me out! Let me out!". You looked around and you find a coffin. It's where the sound is coming from. As you got close to it, it started shaking. You opened it and out came a little ghost. It's your pet now and you need to take care of it. What would you name it?
